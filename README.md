The code assumes you already have dataset in your drive, specifically the 'bbc' folder should be in your root directory on your drive.
As outlined in the report, the file from 'sports' labeled '199.txt' has been removed from the dataset due to an erroneous character.

Any remaining instructions are contained within the Jupyter notebook.
